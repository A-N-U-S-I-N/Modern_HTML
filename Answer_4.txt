1. By providing alternative texts using <alt> tag to all the multimedia content like images, audio and video so that it can be easily acccessed and interacted by people with disabilities using screen screaders.

2. By providing title to every links and content using title attribute which will provide a descriptive and meaningful text as a pop up when the user will hover over the element.
